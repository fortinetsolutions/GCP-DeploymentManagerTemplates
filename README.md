# Deployment Manager

Deployment Manager is an infrastructure deployment service that automates the creation and management of Google Cloud resources. 

Write flexible template and configuration files and use them to create deployments that have a variety of Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL configured to work together.

You can use Deployment Manager to create a set of Google Cloud resources and manage them as a unit, called a deployment.

4. Install and initialize the Google Cloud SDK.
5. Configure the gcloud command-line tool to use your project.
